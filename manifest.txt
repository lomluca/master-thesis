This work consists of the files listed in manifest.txt

This work consists of the following files
    manifest.txt
    toptesi.dtx
    toptesi-doc-xetex.tex
    toptesi-example.tex
    toptesi-example-xetex
    README
    toptesi-exmple.xmpdata
    toptesi-doc-xetex-def.ps
The files derived from the work are the following:

    toptesi.cls
    toptesi.sty
    topcoman.sty
    topfront.sty
    toptesi.cfg
    toptesi.pdf
    toptesi-doc-xetex.pdf
    toptesi-doc-xetex-a.pdf
    toptesi-example.pdf
    toptesi-example-xetex.pdf

The toptesi.dtx file is self extracting and self documenting; if you run
pdfLaTeX on it you get at the same time the class, the style and the configuration files, together with the English documented file.

The Italian documentation is obtained by running XeLaTeX on 
toptesi-doc-xetex.tex

The two documentations pdf files, toptesi.pdf and toptesi-doc-xetex.pdf,
are complementary to one another. The third documentation file 
toptesi-doc-xetex-a.pdf is just the PDF/A-b version of 
toptesi-doc-xetex.pdf.

The files

    toptesi-example.tex and toptesi-example-xetex.tex

are examples of the usage of this work, the former to be run with pdfLaTeX, 
the latter with XeLaTeX; they may be used as templates, but in themselves, although part of this Work, they may be used by the end user the way s/he likes best, in order to use them as templates, but the files should not be modified unless their names are changed.

The files toptesi-example.xmpdata and toptesi-doc-xetex-def.ps
are examples of the contents and format of the metadata that must be
included into the same directotory as the thesis main file in order to be
able to use pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX + ghostscript for producing a file that hopefully is 
PDF/A-1b compliant (PDF/A-1b is the "weak" archivable PDF format).
